# Manufacturing-Plant
"Optimizing Production with Simulated Workforce Management" is a project aimed at enhancing manufacturing plant performance through simulation technology. By orchestrating the activities of part workers and product workers in a virtual environment, the program leverages parallel implementation and thread management to boost efficiency while ensuring fair treatment for all workers. Key objectives include optimizing production throughput, enhancing worker experience, facilitating decision-making, and validating proposed changes to the manufacturing process. The methodology involves multi-threaded approaches, including parallel implementation, thread management, and synchronization techniques, to accurately model worker activities and resource utilization. Key features of the simulation program include load order generation, buffer management, and product assembly, all designed to optimize plant performance. Through continuous improvement and innovation, the project aims to drive higher productivity, lower costs, and better overall performance in manufacturing plants.
